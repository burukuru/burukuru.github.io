      <h1>Broken search</h1>
<p>One of our clients have been having issue with the search function on
their Drupal site. This full text search was powered by <strong>Solr</strong> behind
the scenes. The issue only only ever occurred when the user was logged
in so it was never flagged up to us.</p>
<p>Recently we've tried to migrate them to a new server and lots of new
changes had to be made; the issue started appearing for all users, even
those that aren't logged in so I decided to take a look.</p>
<h1>Symptoms and debugging</h1>
<p>The issue only manifested itself with a simple error message:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The Apache Solr search engine is not available. Please contact your site administrator.
</pre></div>


<p>This wasn't really helpful and the Tomcat log files didn't show any
issues. The <a href="https://skybert.wordpress.com/2009/07/22/how-to-get-solr-to-log-to-a-log-file/">Solr
logs</a>
didn't show the query so I assumed it didn't even hit the Solr app;
manual queries were working fine via the Solr web interface and appeared
in the logs. The next step was to extract the Solr query that Drupal was
running.</p>
<h2>The easy way - Drupal</h2>
<p>If you're running Drupal or any codebase where developers are on hand to
debug the app with you, you can dig into the code and make the app log
or print out the query to the browser.</p>
<p>I came across this very helpful link on how to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2240049">debug Solr queries in
Drupal</a>. In my case, possibly a
different version of Drupal, the file was different:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">#</span> <span class="nt">grep</span> <span class="nt">-irH</span> <span class="nt">drupal_http_request</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nt">grep</span> <span class="nt">solr</span>
<span class="nt">sites</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nt">all</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nt">modules</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nt">contrib</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nt">apachesolr</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nt">Drupal_Apache_Solr_Service</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">php</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">$</span><span class="nt">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nt">drupal_http_request</span><span class="o">($</span><span class="nt">url</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">$</span><span class="nt">headers</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">$</span><span class="nt">method</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">$</span><span class="nt">content</span><span class="o">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I added "drupal_set_message(check_plain(\$url));" and I saw the query
printed in my browser. And it was a huge query...</p>
<h2>The hard way - anything else</h2>
<p>A lot of the time we would host custom CMS or code that doesn't isn't
maintained by the same developers anymore; in those cases it's much
faster to do the debugging ourselves without digging into the code. If
you're running <strong>SmartOS</strong> and have access to <strong>truss</strong>, this is how to
go about it (strace can probably do something similar in Linux).<br>
This is actually how I went about it before I realised Drupal probably
has an easier way for me to debug the issue.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># truss -o /tmp/truss -wall -rall -vall -p $(pgrep httpd)
</pre></div>


<p>It will help to have a clone of your server or a dev environment so that
the truss output is less messy to read.<br>
Run this and do a search on your website. Wait until it finishes and
Ctrl+C truss.</p>
<p>Search for the query:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># grep -n &quot;G E T / s o l r / s e l e c t &quot; /tmp/truss
248606:24614: G E T / s o l r / s e l e c t ? f l = i d % 2 C n i d % 2 C t
870437:24611: G E T / s o l r / s e l e c t ? f l = i d % 2 C n i d % 2 C t
</pre></div>


<p>You can also search for 8080 or whichever port Tomcat is running on and
the GET line should be not far below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># grep -n AF_INET /tmp/truss.1 | grep 8080
248599:24614: AF_INET name = 127.0.0.1 port = 8080
870430:24611: AF_INET name = 127.0.0.1 port = 8080
</pre></div>


<p>Go to line 248606 in your truss output and your query should be there,
probably spanning a few send() blocks, it should end with a
"\r\n\r\n" string.<br>
After that you should see a recv() block with a response from
Tomcat/Solr. For me, it just showed a "400 Bad Request" error. When I
ran the extracted query with wget, I saw this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Resolving localhost (localhost)... 127.0.0.1
Connecting to localhost (localhost)|127.0.0.1|:8080... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 400 Bad Request
2015-02-24 15:26:15 ERROR 400: Bad Request.
</pre></div>


<p>Once you have the truss output cut down to just the query, you can
remove all the whitespaces, PIDs and system calls; all that will remain
is the actual query that Drupal is running. Mine was quite big:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># wc /tmp/truss 
1 9 39733 /tmp/truss
</pre></div>


<p>That's 39,733 characters!</p>
<h1>Solution was rather straightforward</h1>
<p>So I discovered that the query that Drupal send to Tomcat was humongous.
After a lot of pointless debugging,enabling log files, and looking in
the wrong place, it struck me that it was probably hitting a character
limit. After all the query was not hitting Solr so it must be Tomcat
refusing to process it.</p>
<p>A quick search turned up that the default URL limit on Tomcat was
4096... The setting you need to change is <strong>maxHttpHeaderSize</strong> in
<a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/56691/whats-the-maximum-url-length-in-tomcat">Tomcat's
server.xml</a>.
I set it to 65536 to accommodate some of big queries that were running
and sure enough everything worked fine after a restart!</p>
<p>Retrospectively, I googled the issue again and came across <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/443980">this
link</a> which might be helpful it the
above doesn't resolve your issue.</p>

      <h4>No more Google SMTP for your aliases</h4>
<p>Since August last year, Google have grandfathered a feature in GMail
that allows you to create aliases in your account and send emails as
those aliases from their SMTP servers:</p>
<p><a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/external-addresses-no-longer-use-gmail.html">http://googlesystem.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/external-addresses-no-longer-use-gmail.html</a></p>
<p>For any new aliases, you will need to provide your own SMTP servers.<br>
If you have a VPS of some sort, this is how you can set up simple SMTP
authentication in Exim to pipe your emails through your server and keep
using the Google web interface.</p>
<h4>SMTP Authentication</h4>
<p>LOGIN and PLAIN auth differs in the fact that LOGIN will prompt for the
username/password explicitely whereas in PLAIN the client is expected to
send both in one blob.<br>
Practically the only difference is an additional null byte at the
beginning of the LOGIN blob send to the server.</p>
<h5>LOGIN</h5>
<p>How to set up simple SMTP LOGIN auth with SHA1 (alternative is crypt or
MD5..):</p>
<p>exim.conf file (based on a  Ubuntu template):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>...
CONFDIR = /etc/exim4/
...
begin authenticators

LOGIN:
driver = plaintext
public_name = LOGIN
server_prompts = <span class="ni">&amp;lt;</span>| Username: | Password:
server_advertise_condition = <span class="cp">${</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">def</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">tls_cipher</span> <span class="cp">}</span>
server_condition = &quot;<span class="cp">${</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">crypteq</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="n">auth2</span><span class="cp">}</span>{\\\{sha1\\\}<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">extract</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="cp">}</span>{:}{<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">lookup</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="n">auth1</span><span class="cp">}</span>lsearch{CONFDIR/passwd}{<span class="nv">$value</span>}{*:*}}}}}{1}{0}}&quot;
server_set_id = <span class="nv">$auth1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>passwd file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nl">username</span><span class="p">:[</span><span class="n">PASSWORD</span> <span class="n">HASH</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>How to generate password hash:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>perl -MDigest::SHA=sha1_hex -e &#39;print sha1_hex($ARGV[0]),&quot;\n&quot;&#39; [PASSWORD]
</pre></div>


<p>To test this, you need to encode the username/pass in base64:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">#</span> <span class="nt">cat</span> <span class="nt">encode</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">pl</span>

<span class="err">#</span> <span class="nt">perl</span> <span class="nt">encode</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">pl</span> <span class="s1">&#39;username\0password&#39;</span>

</pre></div>


<h5>PLAIN</h5>
<p>If you'd rather have a PLAIN auth, just change the snippet in exim.conf
to:</p>
<p>exim.conf file</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>...
CONFDIR = /etc/exim4/
...
begin authenticators

PLAIN:
driver = plaintext
public_name = PLAIN
server_advertise_condition = <span class="cp">${</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">def</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">tls_cipher</span> <span class="cp">}</span>
server_condition = &quot;<span class="cp">${</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">crypteq</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="n">auth3</span><span class="cp">}</span>{\\\{sha1\\\}<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">extract</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="cp">}</span>{:}{<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">lookup</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="n">auth2</span><span class="cp">}</span>lsearch{CONFDIR/passwd}{<span class="nv">$value</span>}{*:*}}}}}{1}{0}}&quot;
server_set_id = <span class="nv">$auth2</span>
</pre></div>


<p>to test, run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># perl encode.pl &#39;\0username\0password&#39;
AHVzZXJuYW1lAHBhc3N3b3Jk
# exim -bh localhost
&amp;gt; ehlo test
&amp;gt; auth plain AHVzZXJuYW1lAHBhc3N3b3Jk

<h5>SSL</h5>
<p>Test with SSL by using this instead of 'exim -bh':</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>openssl s_client -connect server.com:465

  <div>
      <p>I just had the pleasure of resetting some PDUs to factory defaults
today. The models in question were Raritan Dominion PX20
(DPXR20A-16/32). After a mostly fruitless search for 'raritan px reset
to factory default' and 'raritan px restore to factory default', I have
managed to dig out a way to complete my task.</p>
<p>Nothing like homemade commando plugs with kettle leads, courtesy of my
colleague JT.</p>
<p><img alt="Commando leads" src="https://thanhpham.cloud/upload/blog/raritan/IMG_20120529_144041.jpg"></p>
<p>First I needed to upgrade the firmware to the latest version as the
command didn't seem to run on v1.3 for me. Grabbed my binaries from the
<a href="http://www.raritan.com/support/dominion-px/" title="Raritan PX20 firmware">Raritan
website</a>.
I had to flash v1.5.2 before 1.5.5, YMMV. You can upgrade firmware using
the web interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hook up to the console of the PDU with a DB9 to USB converter (top)
    and a special Raritan DB9 to Ethernet console cable (bottom), like
    this:</li>
<li><img alt="Console cables" src="https://thanhpham.cloud/upload/blog/raritan/IMG_20120528_152609.jpg" title="Console cables"></li>
<li>One of these, a Cisco compatible cable, won't work:</li>
<li><img alt="Wrong console cables" src="https://thanhpham.cloud/upload/blog/raritan/IMG_20120529_144401.jpg" title="Wrong console cables"></li>
<li>As I use Arch Linux I just ran the following as root:</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>screen /dev/ttyUSB0
</pre></div>


<ul>
<li>Set the IP configuration to dhcp: 'config' at the prompt and then
    'dhcp'</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[Old IP address] command: config
IP autoconfiguration (none/dhcp/bootp) [none]: dhcp
</pre></div>


<p>Press [Enter] a few times until the old IP address becomes the new one,
you might have to unplug the network cable and plug it back in. Proceed
with the firmware upgrade in the web browser!</p>
<p>Once the upgrade is completed, go into 'clp' mode in the console and
type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">clp</span><span class="o">:/</span><span class="nt">-</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nt">gt</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="nt">set</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="nt">system1</span> <span class="nt">FactoryDefaults</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nt">true</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Sorted! Now your PDU is ready to go on eBay :)</p>

      <p>A customer called in today saying that their site is not working after
re-pointing the DNS. No changes have been made in a week and it was
working fine before. Typical.</p>
<p>So I turned on Firebug and notice it's a 500 error. Logged into the
server and saw it's a WordPress instance running with PHP on IIS. Great!
For some reason the pages in the browser are completely blank. I loaded
up the page from a local browser and the same thing happens. I double
checked that detailed errors messages have been enabled in IIS and they
were. Very strange.</p>
<p>The IIS log was as unhelpful as ever so I turned to DuckDuckGo (nearly
wrote 'Google' there but I switched my search engine recently). Now I'm
not usually used to WordPress in IIS so didn't think of checking the
php.ini file; later on it turned out that error messages option was not
set  but it's supposedly on by default but errors just decided not to
show.</p>
<p>Cutting to the chase, I dropped the following into the PHP file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ini_set(&#39;display_errors&#39;,true);
</pre></div>


<p>This uncovered  a plugin was installed twice and WordPress was having
none of that. Renamed the file and all was well again. Thanks to <a href="http://www.iis-answers.com/microsoft/IIS/33603808/iis-not-showing-php-errors.aspx">Sadi
from
iis-answers.com</a>
for pointing that out!</p>

Tenkeyless, blue switch edition. It was a toss-up between that and the
HappyHacker and I decided I like the arrow keys too much to let go.
<a href="http://www.keyboardco.com/" title="Keyboard Company">KeyboardCo</a> have
exclusive distribution rights here in the UK so I got mine from there.
Next day delivery, top notch service.</p>

<p>Just above it is my Logitech Wave; quite a nifty design but the quality
isn't amazing and the keys started to stick after about 6 months. Not
bad for £20 though.</p>
<p>The Filco is quite a pricey beast at £114 but I figured as I'm typing
away every day, it will definitely pay itself off.</p>

<p>Shortly after I showed it off to everyone (who cared and had any
interest in keyboards), my friend decided to get a full sized one from
<a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/" title="WASD Keyboards">WASD keyboards</a>. For
those who don't know and haven't clicked the link yet, WASD sell
mechanical keyboards, but what makes them different from the competition
though is that they let you fully <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/firesock/status/202824531398770688/photo/1" title="firesock's WASD keyboard">customise your
keycaps</a>!</p>
<p>As WASD are based on the other side of the pond, I decided to piggy back
on his order and get some custom keys and <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/cherry-mx-rubber-switch-dampeners.html" title="Cherry MX o-rings">some
dampeners</a>
(at the bottom of the link there is a noise comparison between with and
without o-rings).</p>

<p>Now that little baby on the bottom left is a keycap puller that came
free with the WASD keyboard but you can get it separately too. Very nice
of them to include that and it will definitely come in handy if one day
you decide to customise your keycaps or maybe just clean your keyboard.</p>
<p>Starting with the Esc key and the qwerty row.</p>

<p>Nice and easy. Now I heard that the bigger keys are quite different and
it's quite easy to break them if you pull them out like a madman. I
decided to consult the infinite wisdom of the Internet, most precisely
Youtube, for some advice. Stumbled upon <a href="http://youtu.be/1iL8_2Zr36I" title="How to change / remove Filco bigger keycaps">this
video</a>
which was most helpful! You might want to mute the music though. And so
off the big keys went.</p>

<p>There are only 4 long keys on this: the 3 visible ones and the
backspace. After about 1.5 hours, all the keys were dampened. And here
it is in its full glory:</p>

<p>The picture doesn't show it very well but my 'Windows' keys, or 'Meta'
keys as I prefer to call them now, have a Tux on them.</p>
<p>I must say, the dampened keys are gonna take a while to get used to but
they are much quieter than before. Needless to say the feel is amazing
and it's definitely one of the best keyboards I've typed on so far and
I've owned quite a few (Logitech Wave/G15, countless scissor and laptop
keyboards as well as stock DELL keyboards). If your job involves a lot
of tapping away, this will definitely improve your typing comforts.</p>
