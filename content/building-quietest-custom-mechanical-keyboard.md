I have owned and used a mechanical keyboard for the best part of the last 10 years. I even wrote a post when [I modded my Filco]({filename}/modding-the-filco-majestouch-tenkeyless.md) with o-rings. My two main boards were the Filco Majestouch 2 Tenkeyless with brown switches (office) and blue switches (home). Since then I have also tried some different boards:

- Kinesis Advantage #TODO Add link
- Ergodox Infinity
- Atreus

Recently I have decided to take a deeper plunge into the hobby and build something a bit more premium.
I liked some aspects of the Ergodox and Atreus, but neither fit my hands really well, so I decided my new keyboard should have the following:

- split spacebar
- smaller form factor (lose the arrow keys finally)
- still have number row
- fully programmable
- multi-layer
- quieter switches
