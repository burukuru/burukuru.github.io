haproxy site checks  
the issue is haproxy checks against the web server. you can either
specify a full check
(http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/configuration-1.5.html\#check) or
create a separate dummy vhost to check (like i did for unbiased)  
in the first instance, the requests will appear in the access\_log, in
the second instance you can do a log ignore

server {  
server\_name health-check;  
root /var/www/health-check;

access\_log /dev/null;  
error\_log /dev/null;  
}
