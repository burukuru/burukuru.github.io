    <p>Having recently acquired a new PC, after 4 arduous heavy-overclocked
years with my previous one, I had to install Gentoo again.<br>
I've been a Gentoo user for a few years now but I've only installed it
a couple of times. Here are a handful of hiccups I ran into and I
thought I'd jot them down for next time.</p>
<h3>UEFI</h3>
<p>I've only ever installed OSs on BIOS systems with MBR partitions before.
As the new build had a UEFI-capable motherboard and a lot of other cool
kit (an SSD among them), I decided in true Gentoo spirit to make things
faster by skipping the bootloader.</p>
<h4>UEFI Support</h4>
<p>The first issue I ran into is that Gentoo doesn't officially support
installing a UEFI-bootable system; you need to jump over a few hoops.<br>
The Gentoo wiki comes to the rescue as usual with a nice and concise
article on this:</p>
<p>http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/UEFI_Gentoo_Quick_Install_Guide</p>
<h4>Stub kernel and initramfs</h4>
<p>One thing to note when using the stub kernel is that everything needs to
be compiled into the kernel as we are not loading the initramfs
anymore.<br>
This means that any device drivers will need to be compiled in. Because
of some dependencies, the AHCI SATA driver wasn't loaded into mine and I
kept getting a stack trace on kernel boot and the following error
message:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
</pre></div>


<p>I tried compiling the SATA driver in but it only allowed me to select it
as a module. After some tedious troubleshooting, it turned out that one
of the modules selected in the "Serial ATA and Parallel ATA drivers
(libata)" was blocking AHCI SATA from being compiled in. I just
de-selected everything, ticked "AHCI SATA support" and then ticked
whatever else I needed again.</p>
<h4>KDE and X server</h4>
